/*

The Problem:
Calculate the detour distance between two different rides. Given four latitude / longitude pairs, 
where driver one is traveling from point A to point B and driver two is traveling from point C to 
point D, write a function (in your language of choice) to calculate the shorter of the detour 
distances the drivers would need to take to pick-up and drop-off the other driver.

The Solution:
There are two possible routes (ACDB and CABD). We need to calculate which one is the shortest one.
We can do so by simply comparing the distances AB and CD; if AB is longer than CD then ACDB will be 
shorter router and vice versa. The Haversine Formula can be used to calculate the distance between two 
Lat-Long points.
